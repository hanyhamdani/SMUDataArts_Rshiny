# SMUDataArts_Rshiny
Rshiny app draft created for SMU DataArts.

SMU DataArts is helping Arts Organizations across US to overcome challenges posed by Covid-19.
DataArts is using data to help analyze situation, impact and transform the decision making in troublesome Covid time, when organization had to face huge loss because of closure of activities. 

The shiny app code created here, has data for Art Organizations in Kansas City in Missouri. In this app, US Census tract map is used to create heatmap of customers around the city and visualizes discounted ticket impact on ticket sales. 

Note: this is not the final app and uses a part of data just for the portfolio showcase.
